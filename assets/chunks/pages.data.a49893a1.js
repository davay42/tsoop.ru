The almost uninterrupted row of meetups is coming to the turning point. August 2023 is the last month Pirate Bay Phuket exists as a place to host free and open events. Quite rural island, especially during low tourist season can't compete with vivid Asian cities. Glenn, who mafe Pirate Bay possible, moves on with other projects in different places of the world.  It's time to collect all the experience we've gained with all these weekly gatherings and take it further.\\n\\nIt may be an end for a FabLab, but Chromatone is just at the very start! There are so many features to add and bugs to fix in the Chromatone web-site code base. These so much to teach, to learn and to explore with visual music language!  And there are so many people to reach out and get well with. There are ideas and plans on how to move on with our Music Geeks Meetups in other spaces. Let's see how it turns out!\\n\\nThis a bit longer recap was shot at once and then edited by our new member - Alex, a visual artist, who can appreciate the use of color as a means to get deep into music. It's so cool to see how music inspires visual creativity and vice versa. And it's the main case for Chromatone - to be a way to get on the same musical page for people of completely different levels of knowledge and skill.\\n\\nI tried to summarize the way these 34 meetups appeared for me and all the guests, who could get to Pirate Bay in these Thursday nights. It's a pleasure to have a 3 hour meeting with other people interested in deep music explorations.\\n\\nFirst hour to set and tune everything up and get in a proper mood. Share ideas and explorations. And discuss upcoming music. Yes, from 8 PM the jam starts and people start exploring all the possibilities to make pleasant sounds together. Free exchange of motifs, grooves and progressions. Nice time to share instruments and explore new territories.\\n\\nThe second part passes in no time! Everyone easily gets involved into music and just loses any sense of time. Very soon the quest is not how to start, but how to modulate and stop the jamming process. But there's more! Once revealed, new improvised moves may find their place in a more structured performances of the final third part of the meetup. It's purpose is to make something, that has a distinct form. A beginning and an end. A verse, a bridge, a chorus. A modulation or a dance. No actual limits are imposed. Just creative bounds to make room for everyone!\\n\\nLast 15 minutes are for the recap - shooting it on air. It's a way to fix the trace of all the emotions and joy that was experienced together. To share the knowledge with others in space and time. And to share music!\\n\\nThere's so much more to explore in this format and techniques. Let's see how it goes next! See you again!\\n","frontmatter":{"title":"MGM#34","desctiption":"Summarizing the experience","date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","cover":"/media_files/cover/events-mgm-2023-08-34-cover.jpg"},"url":"/events/mgm/2023-08/34/"},{"src":"---\\ntitle: MGM#33\\ndesctiption: Nick and Alex jammin' with another Alex learning music for the first time\\ndate: 2023-08-10\\ncover: 0811-Cover.jpg\\n---\\n\\nJoin us on Thursday night as we dive into the world of melodies and rhythms at our captivating Music Geeks Meetup! The atmosphere was electric as Alex strummed his guitar, while Den skillfully incorporated his condenser microphone into the mix, effortlessly avoiding any pesky feedback loops.\\n\\nAdding to the excitement, Nick joined in to experiment with an array of musical wonders. And then there was newcomer Alex, who we warmly welcomed into our midst. We introduced him to the mesmerizing Chromatone system, unveiling its secrets on how to learn music through a visual journey. With eager fingers, he embraced the vibrant synthesizer keys, infusing the air with his colorful musical ideas. Surprisingly, he quickly found his groove and seamlessly jammed along with us.\\n\\nOur innovative introductory approach continues to evolve, demonstrating that anyone, regardless of age or prior experience, can visually unlock the world of music. It's a testament that delving into melodies isn't as daunting as it seems.\\n\\nEager to explore music visually? Join us every Thursday at the vibrant Pirate Bay in Phuket. But if you're more of an independent explorer, satisfy your curiosity at www.chromatone.center. Get ready to embark on a harmonious adventure like no other!

Together we had a very fun jam in D major and G minor too.\\n\\nWe also battle tested our new wireless in-ear monitoring system - just ran 3 kits of headphones through it.

Also Nok, the opera singer and a vocal teacher, came by for the first time. We got some fancy effects on the vocal mic and she got the opportunity to improvise with her amazing voice and singing techniques. Alex played bass as usual and Denis focused on visual communication in this emergent music band. And finally we've managed to record some nice demo track that you can hear it in the background.

No synths, no amplification - just us and things to make sound with! We used our shared guitar and ukulele enhanced with Chromatone color stickers along with percussion and steel tongue drum. The talks and jams were quite pleasant as we could deal with all the complexities of music communication via our interactive web-site, that could really help us navigate the Em scale and a bit outside of it.\\n\\nWe had a new visitor of the meetup - Andrew, who shared many interesting things about him using AI tools to produce commercial music and other useful info about his creative process.
