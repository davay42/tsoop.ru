New music geeks are now in the community. Renat brought his Syntact and played us some deep kicks and risers and Pasha brought his Circuit and produced nice percussion and lead sounds. Also Nok, the opera singer and a vocal teacher, came by for the first time.

Alex played bass as usual and Denis focused on visual communication in this emergent music band. And finally we've managed to record some nice demo track that you can hear it in the background.
