Last time we made our first music instrument - the single string bottle guitar and then had quite a jam with it as a bass and solo. This time we are going to upgrade it with a new string and a bent neck to have even more fun with it.</p><p>Any visitor of the meetup can have a short talk about any of their interest in music and then we explore the topic deeper together. Eventually we come up with our next build idea. Compose a song, build a synth setup, or may be build some new percussion for us to play? Let&#39;s decide together! No music skills required. Basic English is enough to start. And yeah, the event is free! So if youâ€™re interested in any way of music - see you among us this Thursday at 7pm in Pirate Bay, Phuket town.</p><hr><ul><li>Improved guitar with the curved neck and new string.</li><li>Learned Sondown song <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atcNf8zBB3M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sundown video</a> song</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGuLWL48o-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sundown ENG video</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thechordtab.com/%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B5-%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%95-%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%94-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%87-%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sundown chords</a></li></ul></li></ul>',4);function h(B,m,p,_,E,g){const t=a;return n(),r("div",null,[l,i(t,{video:"rB7gyPbYatM"}),c])}const b=o(d,[["render",h]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
