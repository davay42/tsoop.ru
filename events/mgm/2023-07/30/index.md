Only three geeks this time, yet full 3 hour session of diverse electronic music performed and enjoyed. Now with two ground loop noise isolators and the line module for op-z we can have fully DAWless setup with op-z and iPad running AUM as base parts of it. AUM orchestrates MIDI messages between controllers and synthesizers. OP-Z can merge all these layers of data and sound and there's so much more to explore. And sharing this experience with other musicians is the main goal of our meetups. Bring your instrument and share your experience exploring it with us. See you next Thurday in Pirate Bay, Phuket!
