## Recap

Steadily improving the quality of streams and recordings. This time we succeeded with both!

Smooth live stream of us jamming is here: https://youtube.com/live/FfhZ6RW086s. Tom played drums and bass on OP-Z through the SMK-25 controller and rapped about tropical island life. Gift used Playtronica TouchMe to throw bright funky solos. Denis used his new Line module to route tracks to the effects and make the sounds wide and thick. Together we had a very fun jam in D major and G minor too.

We also battle tested our new wireless in-ear monitoring system - just ran 3 kits of headphones through it. It opens huge possibilities for jamming with live instruments and while staying locked and synced. And there's so much to explore!

See you at Pirate Bay, Phuket. Next Thursday at 7 PM. You can bring your instruments or played shared ones. See you! âœ¨
