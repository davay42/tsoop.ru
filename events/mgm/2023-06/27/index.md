The same meetup, but on a whole new level! New music geeks are now in the community. Renat brought his Syntact and played us some deep kicks and risers and Pasha brought his Circuit and produced nice percussion and lead sounds. Also Nok, the opera singer and a vocal teacher, came by for the first time. We got some fancy effects on the vocal mic and she got the opportunity to improvise with her amazing voice and singing techniques. Alex played bass as usual and Denis focused on visual communication in this emergent music band. And finally we've managed to record some nice demo track that you can hear it in the background. So cool to see Chromatone tools really shining in live action! ☀️

And there will be more! See you next Thursday at the next Music Geeks Meetup in Pirate Bay, Phuket. ✨
