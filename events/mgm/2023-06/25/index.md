25th meetup was nice! We've had the complete rhythm section with our new friend Simon playing drums and Alex on his upgraded bass guitar. Some synths from Logic Pro added color and chords to that solid bass and visual tools could help us coordinate to create a somewhat pleasant 4 minute recording to share with you.

We used the new GPU shader Chromatone circle to visualize chords being played by MIDI controllers to sync our understanding of the notes played. Check it out here: https://chromatone.center/practice/chroma/shader/
