Pirate Bay Music Geeks are experimenting with the format. We've came to the idea of having unplugged acoustic versions of the meetups once in a while. It's very important to have a break with all those screens and devices and meet together just with our sonar abilities. Percussion, all kinds of stringed instruments.

Recap
----

This Thurday we had an unusual meetup - it was all acoustic! No synths, no amplification - just us and things to make sound with! We used our shared guitar and ukulele enhanced with Chromatone color stickers along with percussion and steel tongue drum. The talks and jams were quite pleasant as we could deal with all the complexities of music communication via our interactive web-site, that could really help us navigate the Em scale and a bit outside of it.

We had a new visitor of the meetup - Andrew, who shared many interesting things about him using AI tools to produce commercial music and other useful info about his creative process. Many new ideas emerging! Let's see where it all goes!
