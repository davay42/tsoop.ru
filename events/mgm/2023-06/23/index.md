What a great meetup! We've explored so much together!

Alex brought his new bass guitar and just couldn't stop playing riffs and basslines. But along with that he got our friend's daughters introduced into improvisational playing on ukulele and arpeggiated synth while Denis was struggling with the controllers to make all that sound pleasant and evolving. And we succeded!

Our new Brasilian friend Priscyla learned how to play a C - Dm - G chord progression on the keys and they could fit together with Alex's students playing C - Am - F on ukulele. It was fun, yet rather chaotic. So no live stream this time. Only a recap with some specimens of the music explorations.

Priscyla showed us some modern Brasilian music of different layers. From [Heavy Baile - Maconha & Pente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ok3fs_7LLw) (and [Game Face On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHfo7KGlaFE)) to [Mari Froes](https://youtu.be/8fMVHAXPZLM) and even [Ib√£ Huni Kuin - A Energia da Floresta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hGabTfaM0Y). We learned about [meditative native music](https://youtu.be/j8ObcKIh_hk), that's still performed in native at real ceremonies in Brasil. So much to explore!
