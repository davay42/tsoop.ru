## Hand the drums and drop the bass!

What an amazing meetup! We had nice acoustic jams with two handpans, mini-cajon and a ukulele. We painted Alex's guitar with paint and water together. We discussed many music theory topics and used Chromatone for that extensively. So nice! See you next Thursday!
