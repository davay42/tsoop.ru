We are a portable music lab capable of producing high quality live music. And here's how we implement it in real life. You can participate too!

## Music Geeks Meetups

**Every Thursday at 19:00**

**@ [Pirate Bay FabLab, Phuket, Thailand](https://chromatone.center/academy/centers/phuket/)**

Everyone, who is interested in any way of music, can come and share their passions with other curious people. We jam some grooves, share some ideas and thoughts and then try to combine all that into some creative output like a performance, a recording, a music instrument, or a whole setup of them.

The community oscillates, people come and go, but the format grows and builds momentum. So see you next Thursday at 7 PM in [Pirate Bay](https://chromatone.center/academy/centers/phuket/)!
