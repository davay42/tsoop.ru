    .p-4.text-3xl tsoop is an independent collaborative multimedia project aimed to promote music and multimedia self-expression.

    .p-4 Abbreviation tsoop (рус. цуп) — stands for the space operations control center. Music itself is a range of very special operations with things and devices to make specific air beatings reach people. Some are gifted from birth, many of us have to aquire musical skills with attention and patience later – but mostly people have their own set of ways to participate in music. Stomping, claping, slaping, breathing, plucking, bowing, singing, dancing… name yours! We’re welcoming new approaches to making music more easy and welcoming to learn and practice together.

    .p-4 It’s clear to us that not a huge set of different instruments is needed to cover all the main sound ranges that people can produce. We have small portable acoustic and electronic setups able to engage almost anyone in a nice music jam. And when you add your instruments, it becomes a real jam party! With our attentive guidance and tech support.

    .p-4 Let’s communicate, coordinate and collaborate on joyful music improvisations. From small groups to masses – with some degree of lucidity we can easily produce harmony together!
